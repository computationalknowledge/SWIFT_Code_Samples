// Are you getting Bored yet?
// Wouldn't it be better to have just one type which can work with any value? How about this:

struct Pair<T1, T2> {
    var first: T1
    var second: T2
}

/*We arrived at a generic solution which can be used with any type.
Instead of providing the concrete types of the properties in the structure, we use placeholders: T1 and T2.
We can simply call our struct Pair because we donâ€™t have to specify the supported types in the name of our structure.
Now we can write: */

let floatFloatPair = Pair<Float, Float>(first: 0.3, second: 0.5)
print(floatFloatPair)
// Pair<Float, Float>(first: 0.300000012, second: 0.5)
